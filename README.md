# COS326_Final_Project_STH
This is my COS 326 Final Project which creates a compiler, made from an assignment built during class and expanded on to add additional functionality.

## Getting Started and Running
To run this repository, you will need the `dotnet` [library from Microsoft](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet). This code is known to run on `version 10.0`. To run the project, run `dotnet run` in the Compiler folder.
